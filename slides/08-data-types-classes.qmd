# Warm up

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
library(countdown)
library(tidyverse)
```

## While you wait for class to begin...

-   Go to your `ae` repo, click *Pull* to get today's application exercise to get ready for later.

-   Questions from the prepare materials?

# Questions from last time

## **Pivoting data** {.smaller}

```{r}
#| include: false

patients <- tribble(
  ~patient_id, ~pulse_1, ~pulse_2, ~pulse_3,
  "XYZ", 70, 85, 73,
  "ABC", 90, 95, 102,
  "DEF", 100, 80, 70
)
```

Suppose we have the following patient data:

```{r}
patients
```

And we want to know:

-   Average pulse rate for each patient.

-   Trends in pulse rates across measurements.

## **Pivoting data** {.smaller}

```{r}
#| include: false

patients <- tribble(
  ~patient_id, ~pulse_1, ~pulse_2, ~pulse_3,
  "XYZ", 70, 85, 73,
  "ABC", 90, 95, 102,
  "DEF", 100, 80, 70
)
```

Suppose we have the following patient data:

```{r}
patients
```

And we want to know:

-   Average pulse rate for each patient.

-   Trends in pulse rates across measurements.

These require a *longer* format of the data where all pulse rates are in a single column and another column identifies the measurement number.

## Pivoting data

```{r}
patients_longer <- patients |>
  pivot_longer(
    cols = !patient_id,
    names_to = "measurement",
    values_to = "pulse_rate"
  )
```

## Summarizing pivoted data

```{r}
patients_longer |>
  group_by(patient_id) |>
  summarize(mean_pulse = mean(pulse_rate))
```

## Visualizing pivoted data

```{r}
ggplot(
  patients_longer, 
  aes(x = measurement, y = pulse_rate, group = patient_id, color = patient_id)
  ) +
  geom_line()
```

# Types and classes

## Types and classes

-   Type is how an object is stored in memory, e.g.,

    -   `double`: a real number stored in double-precision floatint point format.
    -   `integer`: an integer (positive or negative)

-   Class is metadata about the object that can determine how common functions operate on that object, e.g.,

    -   `factor`

## Types of vectors

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
You'll commonly encounter:

-   `logical`
-   `integer`
-   `double`
-   `character`
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
You'll less commonly encounter:

-   `list`
-   `NULL`
-   `complex`
-   `raw`
:::
:::

## Types of functions

Yes, functions have types too, but you don't need to worry about the differences in the context of doing data science.

```{r}
typeof(mean) # regular function

typeof(`$`) # internal function

typeof(sum) # primitive function
```

## Factors {.smaller}

A `factor` is a vector that can contain only predefined values.
It is used to store categorical data.

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
x <- factor(c("a", "b", "b", "a"))
x

typeof(x)

attributes(x)
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/08/factor.png){fig-align="center" width="400"}
:::
:::

## Other classes

Just a couple of examples...

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Date:

```{r}
today <- Sys.Date()
today

typeof(today)

attributes(today)
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Date-time:

```{r}
now <- as.POSIXct("2024-02-08 11:45", tz = "EST")
now

typeof(now)

attributes(now)
```

# Application exercise

## `ae-07-population-types`

::: appex
-   Go to the project navigator in RStudio (top right corner of your RStudio window) and open the project called `ae`.

-   If there are any uncommitted files, commit them, and then click **Pull**.

-   Open the file called `ae-07-population-types.qmd` and render it.

# Warm up

```{r}
#| echo: false

library(countdown)
```

## While you wait for class to begin...

-   Go to your `ae` repo, click *Pull* to get today's application exercise to get ready for later.

-   Questions from the prepare materials?

    ```

## Asking good questions {.smaller}

-   Post content questions on Ed Discussion
-   If you have a coding question always provide the code, and if relevant, the error
    -   If this feels impossible, don't fret it, it's ok to ask questions without the code. It's just more efficient with it!
-   Title your thread in a way that can help others (e.g., "Q7" vs. "error with `mutate()` function in Lab 1 - Q7")
-   Check for previous questions

## Coding style + workflow

::: incremental
-   Avoid long lines of code.

    -   We should be able to see [all]{.underline} of your code in the PDF document you submit.

-   Label code chunks.

    -   Do **not** put spaces in the code-chunk `label`s.

-   Render, commit, and push regularly.

    -   Think about it like clicking to save regularly as you type a report.

## Lab 1

# Data frames and `tibble`s

## NYC Flights

-   To demonstrate data wrangling we will use `flights`, a tibble in the **nycflights13** R package.

-   The data set includes characteristics of all flights departing from New York City (JFK, LGA, EWR) in 2013.

```{r}
#| label: load-packages
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
```

## `flights` -- dimensions

-   Number of rows:

```{r}
nrow(flights)
```

. . .

-   Number of columns:

```{r}
ncol(flights)
```

## `flights` -- first look {.smaller}

::: panel-tabset
## `glimpse()`

```{r}
#| label: glimpse-data

glimpse(flights)
```

## `names()`

```{r}
#| label: column-names

names(flights)
```

## `head()`

```{r}
#| label: explore-data

head(flights)
```
:::

## `tibble` vs. data frame

::: incremental
-   **tibble**: an opinionated version of the `R` data frame
-   All tibbles are data frames, but not all data frames are tibbles!
-   Two main differences between a tibble and a data frame:
    -   Printing
    -   Stricter subsetting
:::

## Printing {.smaller}

::: panel-tabset
## `tibble`

Display first 10 rows and all of the columns that fit on the screen will display, along with the type of each column.

```{r}
#| label: tibble-print

flights
```

## `data.frame`

(Attempt to) display all of the data, or die (crash) tryin (if the dataset is too large)!

```{r}
#| label: data-frame-print

cars
```
:::

## Stricter subsetting

::: panel-tabset
## `tibble`

Warning + `NULL` if variable not found.

```{r}
#| label: tibble-subset

flights$apple
```

## `data.frame`

Only `NULL` if variable not found.

```{r}
#| label: data-frame-subset

cars$apple
```

# Data wrangling with `dplyr`

Primary package in the tidyverse for data wrangling

## Row operations

-   `slice()`: chooses rows based on location
-   `filter()`:chooses rows based on column values
-   `arrange()`: changes the order of the rows
-   `sample_n()`: take a random subset of the rows

## `slice()` {.smaller}

Display the first five rows of `flights`:

```{r}
#| label: slice
#| code-line-numbers: "|1|2"

flights |>      # <1>   
  slice(1:5)    # <2>
```

1.  Take the `flights` data frame, **and then**,
2.  Slice its first five rows

## `filter()` {.smaller}

Filter for flights to RDU in `flights`:

```{r}
#| label: filter
#| code-line-numbers: "|1|2"

flights |>                 # <1>   
  filter(dest == "RDU")    # <2>
```

1.  Take the `flights` data frame, **and then**,
2.  Filter for rows where `dest` *is equal to* `RDU`

## The pipe

::: incremental
-   The **pipe**, `|>`, is an operator (a tool) for passing information from one process to another.

-   Use `|>` mainly in data pipelines to pass the output of the previous line of code as the first input of the next line of code.

-   When reading code "in English", say "and then" whenever you see a pipe.

## Delayed flights to RDU

::: demo
Which airline is the most delayed, on average, arriving in RDU from a New York City airport?
:::

. . .

**Goal:**

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| ref.label: pipe-5
```

## The pipe, in action {.smaller}

```{r}
#| label: pipe-1

flights # <1>
```

1.  Take the flights data frame

## The pipe, in action {.smaller}

```{r}
#| label: pipe-2

flights |>               # <1>
  filter(dest == "RDU")  # <2>
```

1.  Take the flights data frame,
2.  **and then** filter for flights going to RDU

## The pipe, in action {.smaller}

```{r}
#| label: pipe-3

flights |>                  # <1>
  filter(dest == "RDU") |>  # <2>
  group_by(carrier)         # <3>
```

1.  Take the flights data frame,
2.  **and then** filter for flights going to RDU,
3.  **and then** group by carrier

## The pipe, in action {.smaller}

```{r}
#| label: pipe-4

flights |>                  # <1>
  filter(dest == "RDU") |>  # <2>
  group_by(carrier) |>      # <3>
  summarize(mean_arr_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) # <4>
```

1.  Take the flights data frame,
2.  **and then** filter for flights going to RDU,
3.  **and then** group by carrier,
4.  **and then** calculate the mean arrival delay for each carrier

## The pipe, in action {.smaller}

```{r}
#| label: pipe-5

flights |>                  # <1>
  filter(dest == "RDU") |>  # <2>
  group_by(carrier) |>      # <3>
  summarize(mean_arr_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) |> # <4>
  arrange(desc(mean_arr_delay)) # <5>
```

1.  Take the flights data frame,
2.  **and then** filter for flights going to RDU,
3.  **and then** group by carrier,
4.  **and then** calculate the mean arrival delay for each carrier,
5.  **and then** arrange in descending order of mean arrival delay.

## Column operations

-   `select()`: changes whether or not a column is included.
-   `rename()`: changes the name of columns.
-   `mutate()`: changes the values of columns and creates new columns.

## Groups of rows

-   `summarize()`: collapses a group into a single row.
-   `count()`: count unique values of one or more variables.
-   `group_by()`: perform calculations separately for each value of a variable

# Application exercise

## `ae-04-flights-wrangling`

::: appex
-   Go to the project navigator in RStudio (top right corner of your RStudio window) and open the project called `ae`.

-   If there are any uncommitted files, commit them, and then click **Pull**.

-   Open the file called `ae-04-flights-wrangling.qmd` and render it.

## Recap: pipe {.smaller}

-   The pipe operator passes what comes before it into the function that comes after it as the first argument in that function.

```{r}
sum(1, 2)
1 |> 
  sum(2)
```

-   Always use a line break after the pipe, and indent the next line of code.
    -   Just like always use a line break between layers of ggplots, after `+`, and indent the next line.

## Recap: logical operators {.smaller}

| operator | definition                   |
|:---------|:-----------------------------|
| `<`      | is less than?                |
| `<=`     | is less than or equal to?    |
| `>`      | is greater than?             |
| `>=`     | is greater than or equal to? |
| `==`     | is exactly equal to?         |
| `!=`     | is not equal to?             |

## Recap: logical operators {.smaller}

| operator      | definition                                               |
|:--------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
| `x & y`       | is x AND y?                                              |
| `x \| y`      | is x OR y?                                               |
| `is.na(x)`    | is x NA?                                                 |
| `!is.na(x)`   | is x not NA?                                             |
| `x %in% y`    | is x in y?                                               |
| `!(x %in% y)` | is x not in y?                                           |
| `!x`          | is not x? (only makes sense if `x` is `TRUE` or `FALSE`) |

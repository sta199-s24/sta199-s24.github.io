Create a new dataset that only contains flights that do not have a missing departure time. Include the columns `year`, `month`, `day`, `dep_time`, `dep_delay`, and `dep_delay_hours` (the departure delay in hours). *Hint: Note you may need to use `mutate()` to make one or more of these variables.*\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n2.  For each airplane (uniquely identified by `tailnum`), use a `group_by()` paired with `summarize()` to find the sample size, mean, and standard deviation of flight distances. Then include only the top 5 and bottom 5 airplanes in terms of mean distance traveled per flight in the final data frame.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n",

We first specify the data set we will use with `data = bechdel`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = bechdel)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ae-02-bechdel-dataviz_files/figure-html/plot-base-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   The `mapping` argument is paired with an aesthetic (`aes()`), which tells us how the variables in our data set should be mapped to the visual properties of the graph.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(\n  data = bechdel, \n  mapping = aes(x = budget_2013, y = gross_2013)\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ae-02-bechdel-dataviz_files/figure-html/plot-aesthetic-mapping-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs we previously mentioned, we often omit the names of the first two arguments in R functions.\nSo you'll often see this written as:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(bechdel, aes(x = budget_2013, y = gross_2013))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ae-02-bechdel-dataviz_files/figure-html/plot-simplified-call-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote that the result is exactly the same.\n\n-   The `geom_xx` function specifies the type of plot we want to use to represent the data. In the code below, we use `geom_point` which creates a plot where each observation is represented by a point.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(bechdel, aes(x = budget_2013, y = gross_2013)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: Removed 15 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ae-02-bechdel-dataviz_files/figure-html/plot-point-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote that this results in a warning as well.\nWhat does the warning mean?\n\n## Gross revenue vs. budget\n\n### Step 1 - Your turn\n\nModify the following plot to change the color of all points to a different color.\n\n::: callout-tip\nSee <http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf> for many color options you can use by name in R or use the [hex code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors) for a color of your choice.\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(bechdel, aes(x = budget_2013, y = gross_2013)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"deepskyblue3\") \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: Removed 15 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ae-02-bechdel-dataviz_files/figure-html/plot-point-color-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Step 2 - Your turn\n\nAdd labels for the title and x and y axes.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(bechdel, aes(x = budget_2013, y = gross_2013))+\n  geom_point(color = \"deepskyblue3\") + \n  labs(\n    x = \"___\", \n    y = \"___\", \n    title = \"___\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: Removed 15 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ae-02-bechdel-dataviz_files/figure-html/plot-labels-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Step 3 - Your turn\n\nAn `aes`thetic is a visual property of one of the objects in your plot.\nCommonly used aesthetic options are:\n\n-   color\n-   fill\n-   shape\n-   size\n-   alpha (transparency)\n\nModify the plot below, so the `color` of the points is based on the variable `binary`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(bechdel, aes(x = budget_2013, y = gross_2013)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  labs(\n    x = \"Budget (in 2013 $)\", \n    y = \"Gross revenue (in 2013 $)\", \n    title = \"Gross revenue vs. budget, by ___\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: Removed 15 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ae-02-bechdel-dataviz_files/figure-html/plot-aes-color-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Step 4 - Your turn\n\nExpand on your plot from the previous step to make the size of your points based on `roi`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Step 5 - Your turn\n\nExpand on your plot from the previous step to make the transparency (`alpha`) of the points 0.5.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Step 6 - Your turn\n\nExpand on your plot from the previous step by using `facet_wrap` to display the association between budget and gross for different values of `clean_test`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Step 7 - Demo\n\nImprove your plot from the previous step by making the x and y scales more legible.\n\n::: callout-tip\nMake use of the [**scales**](https://scales.r-lib.org/) package, specifically the `scale_x_continuous()` and `scale_y_continuous()` functions.\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Step 8 - Your turn\n\nExpand on your plot from the previous step by using `facet_grid` to display the association between budget and gross for different combinations of `clean_test` and `binary`.\nComment on whether this was a useful update.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\nAdd comment here...\n\n### Step 9 - Demo\n\nWhat other improvements could we make to this plot?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Render, commit, and push\n\n1.

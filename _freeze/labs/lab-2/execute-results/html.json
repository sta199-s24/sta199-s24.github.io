You should now see the RStudio environment.\n\n### Clone the repo & start new RStudio project\n\n-   Go to the course organization at [github.com/sta199-s24](https://github.com/sta199-s24) organization on GitHub.\n    Click on the repo with the prefix **lab-2**.\n    It contains the starter documents you need to complete the lab.\n\n-   Click on the green **CODE** button, select **Use SSH** (this might already be selected by default, and if it is, you'll see the text **Clone with SSH**).\n    Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.\n\n-   In RStudio, go to *File* ➛ *New Project* ➛*Version Control* ➛ *Git*.\n\n-   Copy and paste the URL of your assignment repo into the dialog box *Repository URL*. Again, please make sure to have *SSH* highlighted under *Clone* when you copy the address.\n\n-   Click *Create Project*, and the files from your GitHub repo will be displayed in the *Files* pane in RStudio.\n\n-   Click *lab-2.qmd* to open the template Quarto file.\n    This is where you will write up your code and narrative for the lab.\n\n### First steps\n\nIn `lab-2.qmd`, update the `author` field to your name, render your document and examine the changes.\nThen, in the Git pane, click on **Diff** to view your changes, add a commit message (e.g., \"Added author name\"), and click **Commit**.\nThen, push the changes to your GitHub repository, and in your browser confirm that these changes have indeed propagated to your repository.\n\n::: callout-important\nIf you run into any issues with the first steps outlined above, flag a TA for help before proceeding.\n:::\n\n## Packages\n\nIn this lab we will work with the **tidyverse** package, which is a collection of packages for doing data analysis in a \"tidy\" way.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Render** the document which loads this package with the `library()` function.\n\n::: callout-note\nRemember: The rendered document will include a message about which packages the tidyverse package is loading along with it.\nIt's just R being informative, a **message** does not indicate anything is wrong (it's not a **warning** or an **error**).\n:::\n\n## Guidelines\n\nAs we've discussed in lecture, your plots should include an informative title, axes should be labeled, and careful consideration should be given to aesthetic choices.\n\nIn addition, the code should all the code should be be able to be read (not run off the page) when you render to PDF.\nMake sure that is the case, and add line breaks where the code is running off the page.[^1]\n\n[^1]: Remember, haikus not novellas when writing code!\n\n::: callout-note\nContinuing to develop a sound workflow for reproducible data analysis is important as you complete the lab and other assignments in this course.\nThere will be periodic reminders in this assignment to remind you to **render, commit, and push** your changes to GitHub.\nYou should have at least 3 commits with meaningful commit messages by the end of the assignment.\n:::\n\n# Questions\n\n## Part 1\n\n**Back to the Midwest!**\n\nIn this part you will revisit and build on some of your findings from Lab 1, where you explored the `midwest` data frame.\nRemember that this data frame is bundled with the **ggplot2** package and is automatically loaded when you load the tidyverse package.\nAs a refresher, the data contains demographic characteristics of counties in the Midwest region of the United States.\nYou can read documentation for the data set, including variable definitions by typing `?midwest` in the Console or searching for `midwest` in the Help pane.\n\n### Question 1\n\nCalculate the number of counties in each state and display your results in descending order of number of counties.\nWhich state has the highest number of counties, and how many?\nWhich state has the lowest number, and how many?\n\n::: callout-note\nThe number of counties in a state can change over time, so the values you see in this output may not be true today.\n:::\n\n::: render-commit-push\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message \"Added answer for Question 1\".\n\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n:::\n\n### Question 2\n\nWhile in a given state two counties can't have the same name, across states some county names might be shared.\nA classmate says \"Look at that, there is a county called \\_\\_\\_ in each state in this dataset!\" In a single pipeline, discover all counties that could fill in the blank.\nYour response should be a data frame with only the county names that could fill in the blank and how many times they appear in the data.\n\n::: callout-tip\nYou will want to use the `filter()` function in your answer, which requires a logical condition to describe what you want to filter for.\nFor example `filter(x > 2)` means filter for values of `x` greater than 2, `filter(y <= 3)` means filter for values of y less than or equal to 3.\n\nThe table below is a summary of logical operators and how to articulate them in R.\n\n| operator      | definition                |\n|---------------|---------------------------|\n| `<`           | less than                 |\n| `<=`          | less than or equal to     |\n| `>`           | greater than              |\n| `>=`          | greater than or equal to  |\n| `==`          | exactly equal to          |\n| `!=`          | not equal to              |\n| `x & y`       | `x` AND `y`               |\n| `x` \\| `y`    | `x` OR `y`                |\n| `is.na(x)`    | test if `x` is `NA`       |\n| `!is.na(x)`   | test if `x` is not `NA`   |\n| `x %in% y`    | test if `x` is in `y`     |\n| `!(x %in% y)` | test if `x` is not in `y` |\n| `!x`          | not `x`                   |\n:::\n\n::: render-commit-push\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message \"Added answer for Question 2\".\n\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n:::\n\n### Question 3\n\nReturn to the following box plot of population densities where you were asked to identify at least one outlier.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lab-2_files/figure-html/popdensity-boxplot-1.png){width=480}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn this question part, we want you to revisit this box plot and identify the counties described in each part.\n\na\\.\nThe counties with a population density higher than 25,000.\nYour code must use the `filter()` function.\n\nb\\.\nThe county with the highest population density.\nYour code must use the `max()` function.\n\nAnswer using a single data wrangling pipeline for each part.\nYour response should be a data frame five columns: county name, state name, population density, total population, and area, in this order.\nIf your response has multiple rows, the data frame should be arranged in descending order of population density.\n\n::: render-commit-push\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message \"Added answer for Question 3\".\n\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n:::\n\n### Question 4\n\nIn Lab 1 you were also asked to describe the distribution of population densities.\nThe following is one acceptable description that touches on shape, center, and spread of this distribution.\nCalculate the values that should go into the blanks.\n\n> The distribution of population density of counties is unimodal and extremely right-skewed.\n> A typical Midwestern county has population density of \\_\\_\\_\\_ people per unit area.\n> The middle 50% of the counties have population densities between \\_\\_\\_ to \\_\\_\\_ people per unit area.\n\n::: callout-tip\nThink about which measures of center and spread are appropriate for skewed distributions.\n:::\n\n::: render-commit-push\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message \"Added answer for Question 4\".\n\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n:::\n\n### Question 5\n\nAnother visualization from Lab 1 was the following that showed the proportion of urban counties in each state.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lab-2_files/figure-html/metro-barplot-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nCalculate these proportions in a single data pipeline.\n\n::: callout-tip\nRemember, you'll first need to create a new variable called `metro` which takes on the value `Yes` if the value of `inmetro` is 1, and `No` otherwise.\nYou can refer to [Lab 1](/labs/lab-1.html#question-6) if you need a refresher on how to do this.\n:::\n\n::: render-commit-push\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message \"Added answer for Question 5\".\n\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n:::\n\n### Question 6\n\nReturn to the following scatter plot of percentage below poverty vs. percentage of people with a college degree, where the color and shape of points are determined by `state` where you were asked to identify at least one county that is a clear outlier by name.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lab-2_files/figure-html/percollege-percbelowpoverty-scatterplot-1.png){width=480}\n:::\n:::\n\n\na\\.\nIn a single pipeline, identify the observations marked in the orange square on the upper left corner.\nYour answer should be a data frame with four variables: county, state, percentage below poverty, and percentage college educated.\n\nb\\.\nIn a single pipeline, identify the observations marked in the red square in the plot above.\nYour answer should again be a data frame with four variables: county, state, percentage below poverty, and percentage college educated.\n\nc\\.\nBring your answers from part (a) and part (b) together!\nIn a single pipeline, and a single `filter()` statement, identify the observations marked in the red and orange square in the plot above.\nYour answer should again be a data frame with four variables: county, state, percentage below poverty, and percentage college educated.\n\nd\\.\nCreate a new variable in `midwest` called `potential_outlier`.\nThis variable should take on the value:\n\n-   `Yes` if the point is one the ones you identified in part (c), i.e., one of the points marked in the squares in the plot above.\n\n-   `No` otherwise.\n\nThen, display the updated `midwest` data frame, with county, state, percentage below poverty, percentage college educated, `potential_outlier` as the selected variables, arranged in ascending order of `potential_outlier`.\n\nc\\.\nRecreate the visualization above, i.e. a scatterplot of percentage below poverty vs. percentage of people with a college degree, however color the points by the newly created `potential_outlier` variable instead of state.\n\n::: render-commit-push\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message \"Added answer for Question 6\".\n\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n:::\n\n### Question 7\n\na\\.\nIn a single pipeline, calculate the total population for each state and save the resulting data frame as `state_population` and display it in descending order of total population.\n\nb\\.\nThen, in a separate pipeline, calculate the proportion of the total population in each state and, once again, display the results in descending order of proportion of population.\n\n::: callout-tip\nIn answering parts (a) and (b), you'll create two new variables, one for total population and other for proportion of total proportion.\nMake sure to give them \"reasonable\" names – short but evocative.\n:::\n\nc\\.\nWhich Midwestern state is most populous and what percent of the Midwest population lives there?\nWhich is the least populous and what percent lives there?\n\n::: render-commit-push\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message \"Added answer for Question 7\".\n\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n:::\n\n### Question 8\n\nCalculate the average percentage below poverty for each state and save the resulting data frame as `state_poverty` with the columns `state` and `mean_percbelowpoverty`.\n\nThen, in a new pipeline, display the `state_poverty` data frame in ascending order of `mean_percbelowpoverty`.\nWhich state has the lowest average percentage below poverty across its counties?\nWhich state has the highest average percentage below poverty across its counties?\n\n::: render-commit-push\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message \"Added answer for Question 8\".\n\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n:::\n\n## Part 2\n\n**All about `group_by()`!**\n\n### Question 9\n\nSuppose we have the following data frame:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf <- tibble(\n  var_1 = c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50),\n  var_2 = c(\"Pizza\", \"Burger\", \"Pizza\", \"Pizza\", \"Burger\"),\n  var_3 = c(\"Apple\", \"Apple\", \"Pear\", \"Pear\", \"Banana\")\n)\n\ndf\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 5 × 3\n  var_1 var_2  var_3 \n  <dbl> <chr>  <chr> \n1    10 Pizza  Apple \n2    20 Burger Apple \n3    30 Pizza  Pear  \n4    40 Pizza  Pear  \n5    50 Burger Banana\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\na\\.\nWhat does the following code chunk do?\nRun it and analyze the result and articulate in words what `arrange()` does.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf |>\n  arrange(var_2)\n```\n:::\n\n\nb\\.\nWhat does the following code chunk do?\nRun it and analyze the result and articulate in words what `group_by()` does.\nAlso comment on how it's different from the `arrange()` in part (a)?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf |>\n  group_by(var_2)\n```\n:::\n\n\nc\\.\nWhat does the following code chunk do?\nRun it and analyze the result and articulate in words what the pipeline does.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf |>\n  group_by(var_2) |>\n  summarize(mean_var_1 = mean(var_1))\n```\n:::\n\n\nd\\.\nWhat does the following code chunk do?\nRun it and analyze the result and articulate in words what the pipeline does.\nThen, comment on what the message says.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf |>\n  group_by(var_2, var_3) |>\n  summarize(mean_var_1 = mean(var_1))\n```\n:::\n\n\ne\\.\nWhat does the following code chunk do?\nRun it and analyze the result and articulate in words what the pipeline does, especially mentioning what the `.groups` argument does.\nHow is the output different from the one in part (d).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf |>\n  group_by(var_2, var_3) |>\n  summarize(mean_var_1 = mean(var_1), .groups = \"drop\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nf\\.\nWhat do the following pipelines do?\nRun both and analyze their results and articulate in words what each pipeline does.\nHow are the outputs of the two pipelines different?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf |>\n  group_by(var_2, var_3) |>\n  summarize(mean_var_1 = mean(var_1), .groups = \"drop\")\n\ndf |>\n  group_by(var_2, var_3) |>\n  mutate(mean_var_1 = mean(var_1))\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: render-commit-push\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.\n\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n:::\n\n### Question 10\n\nDid you select your pages on Gradescope?\nYou don't need to write an answer for this question, if you select your pages when you upload your lab to Gradescope, you'll get full points on this question.\nOtherwise, you'll get a 0 on this question.[^2]\n\n[^2]: We're assigning points to this seemingly trivial task because not selecting your pages and questions will greatly slow down the grading.\n    So we want to make sure you're properly motivated to complete this task!\n\n# Wrap-up\n\n## Submission\n\nOnce you are finished with the lab, you will submit your final PDF document to Gradescope.\n\n::: callout-warning\nBefore you wrap up the assignment, make sure all of your documents are updated on your GitHub repo.\nWe will be checking these to make sure you have been practicing how to commit and push changes.\n\nYou must turn in a PDF file to the Gradescope page by the submission deadline to be considered \"on time\".\n:::\n\nTo submit your assignment:\n\n-   Go to <http://www.gradescope.com> and click *Log in* in the top right corner.\n-   Click *School Credentials* $\\rightarrow$ *Duke NetID* and log in using your NetID credentials.\n-   Click on your *STA 199* course.\n-   Click on the assignment, and you'll be prompted to submit it.\n-   Mark all the pages associated with question. All the pages of your lab should be associated with at least one question (i.e., should be \"checked\").\n\n::: callout-important\n## Checklist\n\nMake sure you have:\n\n-   attempted all questions\n-   rendered your Quarto document\n-   committed and pushed everything to your GitHub repository such that the Git pane in RStudio is empty\n-   uploaded your PDF to Gradescope\n-   selected pages associated with each question on Gradescope\n:::\n\n## Grading\n\nThe lab is graded out of a total of 50 points.\n\nOn Questions 1 through 9, you can earn up to 5 points on each question:\n\n-   5: Response shows excellent understanding and addresses all or almost all of the rubric items.\n\n-   4: Response shows good understanding and addresses most of the rubric items.\n\n-   3: Response shows understanding and addresses a majority of the rubric items.\n\n-   2: Response shows effort and misses many of the rubric items.\n\n-   1: Response does not show sufficient effort or understanding and/or is largely incomplete.\n\n-   0: No attempt.\n\nOn Question 10, you can earn either 0 or 5 points for selecting questions and pages on Gradescope:\n\n-   5: Selected questions and pages on Gradescope.\n-   0: Did not select some or all questions and pages on Gradescope.\n",

The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) is a nonprofit membership association of faculty and other academic professionals.
[This report](https://www.aaup.org/sites/default/files/files/AAUP_Report_InstrStaff-75-11_apr2013.pdf) by the AAUP shows trends in instructional staff employees between 1975 and 2011, and contains the following image.
What trends are apparent in this visualization?

## Packages

```{r}
#| label: packages
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
library(ggthemes)
```

## Data

Each row in this dataset represents a faculty type, and the columns are the years for which we have data.
The values are percentage of hires of that type of faculty for each year.

```{r}
#| label: load-data-staff
#| message: false
staff <- read_csv("https://sta199-s24.github.io/data/instructional-staff.csv")
staff
```

## Recreate

-   **Your turn (10 minutes):** Recreate the visualization above. Try to match as many of the elements as possible. Hint: You might need to reshape your data first.

```{r}
#| label: reshape-data
# add code here
```

```{r}
#| label: recreate-plot
#| fig-asp: 0.5
#| fig-width: 12.0
# add code here
```

## Represent percentages as parts of a whole

-   **Demo:** Recreate the previous visualization where the percentages are represented as parts of a whole.

```{r}
#| label: percentages
#| fig-asp: 0.5
#| fig-width: 12.0
# add code here
```

## Place time on x-axis

-   **Demo:** Convert the visualization to a line plot with time on the x-axis.

```{r}
#| label: time-on-x
#| fig-asp: 0.5
#| fig-with: 12.0
# add code here
```

## Pay attention to variable types

-   **Question:** What is wrong with the x-axis of the plot above? How can you fix it?

*Add response here.*

-   **Your turn:** Implement the fix for the x-axis of the plot.

```{r}
#| label: var-type
#| fig-asp: 0.5
#| fig-width: 12.0
# add code here
```

## Use an accessible color scale

-   **Question:** What do we mean by an accessible color scale? What types of color vision deficiencies are there?

*Add response here.*

-   **Demo:** What does the plot look like to people with various color vision deficiencies?

-   **Demo:** Remake the plot with an accessible color scale.

```{r}
#| label: accessible color scale
#| fig-asp: 0.5
#| fig-width: 12.0
# add code here
```

## Use direct labeling

-   **Demo:** Remove the legend and add labels for each line at the end of the line (where `x` is the `max(x)` recorded).

```{r}
#| label: direct-labelling
#| fig-asp: 0.5
#| fig-width: 12.0
# add code here
```

## Use color to draw attention

-   **Demo:** Redo the line plot where Part-time Faculty is red and the rest are gray.

```{r}
# label: recode
# add code here
```

```{r}
#| label: color-attention
#| fig-asp: 0.5
#| fig-width: 12.0

# add code here
```

## Pick a purpose

```{r}
#| label: purpose
#| fig-asp: 0.5
#| fig-width: 12.0
# add code here
```

## Use labels to communicate the message

```{r}
#| label: communicate-message
#| fig-asp: 0.5
#| fig-width: 12.0
# add code here
```

## Simplify

```{r}
#| label: simplify
#| fig-asp: 0.5
#| fig-width: 12.0
# add code here
```

## Summary

-   Represent percentages as parts of a whole
-   Place variables representing time on the x-axis when possible
-   Pay attention to data types, e.g., represent time as time on a continuous scale, not years as levels of a categorical variable
-   Prefer direct labeling over legends
-   Use accessible colors
-   Use color to draw attention
-   Pick a purpose and label, color, annotate for that purpose
-   Communicate your main message directly in the plot labels
-   Simplify before you call it done (a.k.a. "Before you leave the house, look in the mirror and take one thing off")

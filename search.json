If you need them to be in another format, you need to explicitly make that transformation, which you can do so within the pivot_longer() function.\nYou can tweak a plot forever, but at some point the tweaks are likely not very productive. However, you should always be critical of defaults (however pretty they might be) and see if you can improve the plot to better portray your data / results / what you want to communicate."

But, the long answer is, sure! But you will need to install a specific versions of R and RStudio for everything to work as expected. You will also need to install the R packages we‚Äôre using as well as have Git installed on your computer. These are not extremely challenging things to get right, but they are not trivial either, particularly on certain operating systems. Myself and the TAs are always happy to provide help with any computational questions when you‚Äôre working in the containers we have provided for you. If you‚Äôre working on your local setup, we can‚Äôt guarantee being able to resolve your issues, though we‚Äôre happy to try.\nIf you want to take this path, here is what you need to do:\n\nDownload and install R 4.3.2: https://cran.r-project.org/\nDownload and install RStudio: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\nInstall Quarto 1.4: https://quarto.org/docs/download/prerelease.html\nInstall Git: https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html\nInstall any necessary packages with install.packages(\"___\")\n\nAnd I‚Äôd like to reiterate again that successful installation of these software is not a learning goal of this course. So if any of this seems tedious or intimidating in any way, just use the computing environment we have set up for you. More on that here.",

It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity and in alignment with Duke‚Äôs Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.\nFurthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities. To help accomplish this:\n\nIf you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don‚Äôt hesitate to come and talk with me. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your academic dean is an excellent resource.\nI (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please let me or a member of the teaching team know.\n\n\n\nPronouns\nPronouns are meaningful tools to communicate identities and experiences, and using pronouns supports a campus environment where all community members can thrive. Please update your gender pronouns in Duke Hub. You can learn more at the Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity‚Äôs website.\n\n\nAccessibility\nIf there is any portion of the course that is not accessible to you due to challenges with technology or the course format, please let me know so we can make appropriate accommodations.\nThe Student Disability Access Office (SDAO) is available to ensure that students are able to engage with their courses and related assignments.

My role as instructor is to introduce you to new methods, tools, and techniques, but it is up to you to take them and make use of them. A lot of what you do in this course will involve writing code, and coding is a skill that is best learned by doing. Therefore, as much as possible, you will be working on a variety of tasks and activities throughout each lecture and lab. You are expected to prepare for class by completing assigned readings, attend all lecture and lab sessions, and meaningfully contribute to in-class exercises and discussion. Additionally, some lectures will feature application exercises that will be graded based on completing what we do in class.\nYou are expected to bring a laptop, tablet, or Chromebook to each class so that you can participate in the in-class exercises. Please make sure your device is fully charged before you come to class, as the number of outlets in the classroom will not be sufficient to accommodate everyone.\nLectures will be recorded and posted on Panopto (link to be shared when available) however lecture attendance is mandatory. The recordings are for catching up with classes you miss due to illness, etc. You will not get the most out of this class if you‚Äôre not present and actively participating in it ‚Äì this is true for lectures and labs.",

These exercises which give you an opportunity to practice apply the statistical concepts and code introduced in the prepare assignment. These AEs are due by the end of the week of the corresponding lecture period (Sunday at midnight). To submit the AEs all you need to do is to push your work to your GitHub repo.\nBecause these AEs are for practice, they will be graded based on completion, i.e., a good-faith effort has been made in attempting all parts. Successful on-time completion of at least 80% of AEs will result in full credit for AEs in the final course grade.\n\n\nLabs\nIn labs, you will apply what you‚Äôve learned in the videos and during lectures to complete data analysis tasks. You may discuss lab assignments with other students; however, lab should be completed and submitted individually. Lab assignments must be typed up using Quarto, all work must be pushed to your GitHub repository for the lab, and the PDF output of the lab must be submitted on Gradescope by the deadline.\nLabs are due at 8 am ET on the indicated due date (generally the Monday after the lab).\nThe lowest lab grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nExams\nThere will be two exams in this course. Each exam will include an in-class component (with a cheat sheet) and an open-note take-home component. Through these exams you have the opportunity to demonstrate what you‚Äôve learned in the course thus far. The exams will focus on both conceptual understanding of the content and application through analysis and computational tasks. The content of the exam will be related to the content in videos and reading assignments, lectures, application exercises, and labs.\nMore detail about the exams will be given during the semester.\n\n\nProject\nThe purpose of the project is to apply what you‚Äôve learned throughout the semester to analyze an interesting data-driven research question. The project will be completed with in teams, and each team will present their work in the last lab session of the semester. The write-up will be due on the same day.\nYou cannot pass this course if you have not completed the project.\nMore information about the project will be provided during the semester.",

Your TAs and I will help you be providing you with materials and answering questions and setting a pace, but for this to work you must do the following:\n\nComplete all the preparation work before class.\nAsk questions. As often as you can. In class, out of class. Ask me, ask the TAs, ask your friends, ask the person sitting next to you. This will help you more than anything else. If you get a question wrong on an assessment, ask us why. If you‚Äôre not sure about the lab, ask. If you hear something on the news that sounds related to what we discussed, ask. If the reading is confusing, ask.\nDo the readings.\nDo the lab. The earlier you start, the better. It‚Äôs not enough to just mechanically plow through the exercises. You should ask yourself how these exercises relate to earlier material, and imagine how they might be changed (to make questions for an exam, for example).\nDon‚Äôt procrastinate. The content builds upon what was taught in previous weeks, so if something is confusing to you in Week 2, Week 3 will become more confusing, Week 4 even worse, etc. Don‚Äôt let the week end with unanswered questions. But if you find yourself falling behind and not knowing where to begin asking, come to office hours and work with a member of the teaching team to help you identify a good (re)starting point.",

    "section": "Course policies",
    "text": "Course policies\n\nAcademic honesty\nTL;DR: Don‚Äôt cheat!\nPlease abide by the following as you work on assignments in this course:\n\nCollaboration: Only work that is clearly assigned as team work should be completed collaboratively.\n\nYou may discuss lab assignments with other students; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write up with other students. For team assignments, you may collaborate freely within your team. You may discuss the assignment with other teams; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write up with another team. Unauthorized sharing (or copying) of the code or write up will be considered a violation for all students involved.\nYou may not discuss or otherwise work with others on the exams. Unauthorized collaboration or using unauthorized materials will be considered a violation for all students involved. More details will be given closer to the exam date.\nFor the project, collaboration within teams is not only allowed, but expected. Communication between teams at a high level is also allowed however you may not share code or components of the project across teams.\nOn individual assignments you may not directly share work (including code) with another student in this class, and on team assignments you may not directly share work (including code) with another team in this class.\n\nOnline resources: I am well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. Unless I explicitly tell you not to use something, the course‚Äôs policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g., StackOverflow) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\nUse of generative artificial intelligence (AI): You should treat generative AI, such as ChatGPT, the same as other online resources. There are two guiding principles that govern how you can use AI in this course:1 (1) Cognitive dimension: Working with AI should not reduce your ability to think clearly. We will practice using AI to facilitate‚Äîrather than hinder‚Äîlearning.\n\nEthical dimension: Students using AI should be transparent about their use and make sure it aligns with academic integrity.\n\n\n‚úÖ AI tools for code: You may make use of the technology for coding examples on assignments; if you do so, you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. You may use these guidelines for citing AI-generated content.\n‚ùå AI tools for narrative: Unless instructed otherwise, you may not use generative AI to write narrative on assignments. In general, you may use generative AI as a resource as you complete assignments but not to answer the exercises for you.\n\nYou are ultimately responsible for the work you turn in; it should reflect your understanding of the course content.\n\nIf you are unsure if the use of a particular resource complies with the academic honesty policy, please ask a member of the teaching team.\nRegardless of course delivery format, it is the responsibility of all students to understand and follow all Duke policies, including academic integrity (e.g., completing one‚Äôs own work, following proper citation of sources, adhering to guidance around group work projects, and more). Ignoring these requirements is a violation of the Duke Community Standard. Any questions and/or concerns regarding academic integrity can be directed to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards at conduct@duke.edu.\nAny violations in academic honesty standards as outlined in the Duke Community Standard and those specific to this course will\n\nautomatically result in a 0 for the assignment,\ncan further impact your overall course grade, and\nwill be reported to the Office of Student Conduct for further action.\n\n\n\nLate work & extensions\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline. Note that the lowest lab assignment will be dropped to accommodate such circumstances.\n\nLabs may be submitted up to 3 days late. There will be a 5% deduction for each 24-hour period the assignment is late.\nThere is no late work accepted for application exercises, since these are designed to help you prepare for other assessments in the course.\nThere is no late work accepted for exams.\nThe late work policy for the project will be provided with the project instructions.\n\n\n\nWaiver for extenuating circumstances\nIf there are circumstances that prevent you from completing a lab by the stated due date, you may email the course coordinator, Dr.¬†Mary Knox, before the deadline to waive the late penalty. In your email, you only need to request the waiver; you do not need to provide explanation. This waiver may only be used once in the semester, so only use it for a truly extenuating circumstance.\nIf there are circumstances that are having a longer-term impact on your academic performance, please let your academic dean know, as they can be a resource. Please let Dr.¬†√áetinkaya-Rundel know if you need help contacting your academic dean.\n\n\nRegrade requests\nRegrade requests must be submitted on Gradescope within a week of when an assignment is returned. Regrade requests will be considered if there was an error in the grade calculation or if you feel a correct answer was mistakenly marked as incorrect. Requests to dispute the number of points deducted for an incorrect response will not be considered. Note that by submitting a regrade request, the entire question will be graded which could potentially result in losing points.\nNo grades will be changed after the project presentations.\n\n\nAttendance policy\n\nCOVID Symptoms, Exposure, or Infection: Student health, safety, and well-being are the university‚Äôs top priorities. To help ensure your well-being and the well-being of those around you, please do not come to class if you have tested positive for COVID-19 or have possible symptoms and have not yet been tested. If any of these situations apply to you, you must follow university guidance related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and current health and safety protocols. If you are experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms, contact student health (dshcheckin@duke.edu, 919-681-9355). Learn more about current university policy related to COVID-19 at https://coronavirus.duke.edu. To keep the university community‚Äôs safe and healthy as possible, you will be expected to follow these guidelines. Please reach out to me and your academic dean as soon as possible if you need to quarantine or isolate so that we can discuss arrangements for your continued participation in class.\nInclement weather: In the event of inclement weather or other connectivity-related events that prohibit class attendance, I will notify you how we will make up missed course content and work.¬† Asynchronous catch-up methods may apply.\nReligious accommodations: Students are permitted by university policy to be absent from class to observe a religious holiday. Accordingly, Trinity College of Arts & Sciences and the Pratt School of Engineering have established procedures to be followed by students for notifying their instructors of an absence necessitated by the observance of a religious holiday. Please submit requests for religious accommodations at the beginning of the semester so that we can work to make suitable arrangements well ahead of time. You can find the policy and relevant notification form here: https://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/religious-holidays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for syllabus bounty!\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you‚Äôve read this far in the syllabus, post a picture of your pet if you have one or your favorite meme on ed in this thread!

    "text": "Part 1\nInflation across the world\nFor this part of the analysis you will work with inflation data from various countries in the world over the last 30 years.\n\ncountry_inflation &lt;- read_csv(\"data/country-inflation.csv\")\n\n\nQuestion 1\nGet to know the data.\n\nglimpse() at the country_inflation data frame and answer the following questions based on the output. How many rows does country_inflation have and what does each row represent? How many columns does country_inflation have and what does each column represent?\nDisplay a list of the countries included in the dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nA function that can be useful for part (b) is pull(). Check out its documentation for examples of usage.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\nWhich countries had the top three highest inflation rates in 2021? Your output should be a data frame with two columns, country and 2021, with inflation rates in descending order, and three rows for the top three countries. Briefly comment on how the inflation rates for these countries compare to the inflation rate for United States in that year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nColumn names that are numbers are not considered ‚Äúproper‚Äù in R, therefore to select them you‚Äôll need to surround them with backticks, e.g.¬†select( ` 1993 ` ).\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3\nIn a single pipeline,\n\ncalculate the ratio of the inflation in 2021 and inflation in 1993 for each country and store this information in a new column called inf_ratio,\narrange the data frame in decreasing order of inf_ratio, and\nselect the variables country and inf_ratio to display as the result of the pipeline.\n\nDo not save this new variable in inf_ratio, only calculate and display it so you can answer the following question based on the output of the pipeline.\nWhich country‚Äôs inflation change is the largest over this time period? Did inflation increase of decrease between 1993 and 2021 in this country?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFor this question you‚Äôll once again need to use variables whose names are numbers (years) in your pipeline. Make sure to surround the names of such variables with backticks (`).\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 4\nReshape (pivot) country_inflation such that each row represents a country/year combination, with columns country, year, and annual_inflation. Then, display the resulting data frame and state how many rows and columns it has.\nRequirements:\n\nYour code must use one of pivot_longer() or pivot_wider(). There are other ways you can do this reshaping move in R, but this question requires solving this problem by pivoting.\nIn your pivot_*() function, you must use names_transform = as.numeric as an argument to transform the variable type to numeric as you pivot the data so that in the resulting data frame the year variable is numeric.\nThe resulting data frame must be saved as something other than country_inflation so you (1) can refer to this data frame later in your analysis and (2) do not overwrite country_inflation. Use a short but informative name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe remaining questions in Part 1 require the use of the pivoted data frame from Question 4.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 5\nUse a separate, single pipeline to answer each of the following questions.\nRequirement: Your code must use the filter() function for each part, not arrange().\n\nWhat is the highest inflation rate observed between 1993 and 2021? The output of the pipeline should be a data frame with one row and three columns. In addition to code and output, your response should include a single sentence stating the country and year.\nWhat is the lowest inflation rate observed between 1993 and 2021? The output of the pipeline should be a data frame with one row and three columns. In addition to code and output, your response should include a single sentence stating the country and year.\nPutting (a) and (b) together: What are the highest and the lowest inflation rates observed between 1993 and 2021? The output of the pipeline should be a data frame with two rows and three columns.\n\n\n\nQuestion 6\na. Create a vector called countries_of_interest which contains the names of up tp five countries you want to visualize the inflation rates for over the years. For example, if these countries are T√ºrkiye and United States, you can express this as follows:\n\ncountries_of_interest &lt;- c(\"T√ºrkiye\", \"United States\")\n\nIf they are T√ºrkiye, United States, and China, you can express this as follows:\n\ncountries_of_interest &lt;- c(\n  \"T√ºrkiye\", \"United States\", \"China (People's Republic of)\"\n)\n\nSo on and so forth‚Ä¶ Then, in 1-2 sentences, state why you chose these countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYour countries_of_interest should consist of no more than five countries. Make sure that the spelling of your countries matches how they appear in the dataset.\n\n\nb. In a single pipeline, filter your reshaped dataset to include only the countries_of_interest from part (a), and save the resulting data frame with a new name so you (1) can refer to this data frame later in your analysis and (2) do not overwrite the data frame you‚Äôre starting with. Use a short but informative name. Then, in a new pipeline, find the distinct() countries in the data frame you created.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe number of distinct countries in the filtered data frame you created in part (b) should equal the number of countries you chose in part (a). If it doesn‚Äôt, you might have misspelled a country name or made a mistake in how to filter for these countries. Go back and check your code.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 7\nUsing your data frame from the previous question, create a plot of annual inflation vs.¬†year for these countries. Then, in a few sentences, describe the patterns you observe in the plot, particularly focusing on anything you find surprising or not surprising, based on your knowledge (or lack thereof) of these countries economies.\nRequirements for the plot:\n\nData should be represented with points as well as lines connecting the points for each country.\nEach country should be represented by a different color line and different color and shape points.\nAxes and legend should be properly labeled.\nThe plot should have an appropriate title (and optionally a subtitle).\nPlot should be customized in at least one way ‚Äì you could use a different than default color scale, or different than default theme, or some other customization.\n\n\nIf you haven‚Äôt yet done so, now is a good time to render, commit, and push. Make sure that you commit and push all changed documents and your Git pane is completely empty before proceeding.",

    "text": "Part 1\nLet‚Äôs take a trip to the Midwest!\nWe will use the midwest data frame for this lab. It is part of the ggplot2 R package, so the midwest data set is automatically loaded when you load the tidyverse package.\nThe data contains demographic characteristics of counties in the Midwest region of the United States.\nBecause the data set is part of the ggplot2 package, you can read documentation for the data set, including variable definitions by typing ?midwest in the Console or searching for midwest in the Help pane.\n\nQuestion 1\nVisualize the distribution of population density of counties using a histogram with geom_histogram() with four separate binwidths: a binwidth of 100, a binwidth of 1,000, a binwidth of 10,000, and a binwidth of 100,000. For example, you can create the first plot with:\n\nggplot(midwest, aes(x = popdensity)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Population density\",\n    y = \"Count\",\n    title = \"Population density of midwesten counties\",\n    subtitle = \"Binwidth = 100\"\n  )\n\nYou will need to make four different histograms. Make sure to set informative titles and axis labels for each of your plots. Then, comment on which binwidth is most appropriate for these data and why.\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message ‚ÄúAdded answer for Question 1‚Äù.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\nVisualize the distribution of population density of counties again, this time using a boxplot with geom_boxplot(). Make sure to set informative titles and axis labels for your plot. Then, using information as needed from the box plot as well as the histogram from Question 1, describe the distribution of population density of counties and comment on any potential outliers, making sure to identify at least one county that is a clear outlier by name in your narrative and commenting on whether it makes sense to you that this county is an outlier. You can use the data viewer to identify the outliers interactively, you do not have to write code to identify them.\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message ‚ÄúAdded answer for Question 2‚Äù.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\n\n\nQuestion 3\nCreate a scatterplot of the percentage below poverty (percbelowpoverty on the y-axis) versus percentage of people with a college degree (percollege on the x-axis), where the color and shape of points are determined by state. Make sure to set informative titles, axis, and legend labels for your plot. First, describe the overall relationship between percentage of people with a college degree and percentage below poverty in Midwestern states, making sure to identify at least one county that is a clear outlier by name in your narrative. You can use the data viewer to identify the outliers interactively, you do not have to write code to identify them. Then, comment on whether you can identify how this relationship varies across states.\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message ‚ÄúAdded answer for Question 3‚Äù.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\n\n\nQuestion 4\nNow, let‚Äôs examine the relationship between the same two variables, once again using different colors and shapes to represent each state, and using a separate plot for each state, i.e., with faceting with facet_wrap(). In addition to points (geom_point()), represent the data with a smooth curve fit to the data with geom_smooth(), with the argument se = FALSE. Make sure to set informative titles, axis, and legend labels for your plot. Which plot do you prefer - this plot or the plot in Question 3? Briefly explain your choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nse = FALSE removes the confidence bands around the line. These bands show the uncertainty around the smooth curve. We‚Äôll discuss uncertainty around estimates later in the course and bring these bands back then.\n\n\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message ‚ÄúAdded answer for Question 4‚Äù.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\n\n\nQuestion 5\nDo some states have counties that tend to be geographically larger than others?\nTo explore this question, create side-by-side boxplots of area (area) of a county based on state (state). How do typical county area sizes compare across states? How do variabilities of county sizes compare across states? Which state has the single largest county? Identify the name of this county. You can use the data viewer to identify it interactively, you do not have to write code.\n\nNow is another good time to render, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with a meaningful commit message.\nOnce again, make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterwards.\n\n\n\nQuestion 6\nDo some states have a higher percentage of their counties located in a metropolitan area?\nCreate a segmented bar chart with one bar per state and the bar filled with colors according to the value of metro ‚Äì one color indicating Yes and the other color indicating No for whether a county is considered to be a metro area. The y-axis of the segmented barplot should range from 0 to 1, indicating proportions. Compare the percentage of counties in metro areas across the states based on this plot. Make sure to supplement your narrative with rough estimates of these percentages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\nFor this question, you should begin with the data wrangling pipeline below. We will learn more about data wrangling in the coming weeks, so this is a mini-preview. This pipeline creates a new variable called metro based on the value of the existing variable called inmetro. If the value of inmetro is equal to 1 (inmetro == 1), it sets the value of metro to \"Yes\", and if not, it sets the value of metro to \"No\". The resulting data frame is assigned back to midwest, overwriting the existing midwest data frame with a version that includes the new metro variable.\n\nmidwest &lt;- midwest |&gt;\n  mutate(metro = if_else(inmetro == 1, \"Yes\", \"No\"))\n\n\n\n\nNow is another good time to render, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with a meaningful commit message.\nAnd once again, make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward. We keep repeating this because it‚Äôs important and because we see students forget to do this. So take a moment to make sure you‚Äôre following along with the version control instructions.\n\n\n\nQuestion 7\nRecreate the plot below, and then give it a title. Then, identify at least one county that is a clear outlier in Wisconsin (WI) by name. You can use the data viewer to identify them interactively, you do not have to write code. Comment on the population composition of this county by investigating the percentage of other races living there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\nThe ggplot2 reference for themes will be helpful in determining the theme.\nThe size of the points is 2.\nThe transparency (alpha) of the points is 0.5.\nYou can put line breaks in labels with \\n.\n\n\n\n\nRender, commit, and push your final changes to GitHub with a meaningful commit message.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterwards.",

First, we are going to investigate the relationship between a penguins‚Äô flipper lengths and their body masses.\n\nQuestion: Based on our research focus, which variable is the response variable?\n\nAdd response here\n\nDemo: Visualize the relationship between flipper length and body mass of penguins.\n\n\n# add code here \n\n\nCorrelation\n\nYour turn (5 minutes):\n\nWhat is correlation? What values can correlation take?\nStrength and direction of a linear relationship. It‚Äôs bounded by -1 and 1.\nAre you good at guessing correlation? Give it a try! https://www.rossmanchance.com/applets/2021/guesscorrelation/GuessCorrelation.html\n\nDemo: What is the correlation between flipper length and body mass of penguins?\n\n\n# add code here\n\n\n\nDefining, fitting, and summarizing a model\n\nDemo: Write the population model below that explains the relationship between body mass and flipper length.\n\n\\[\nadd~math~text~here\n\\]\n\nDemo: Fit the linear regression model and display the results. Write the estimated model output below.\n\n\n# add code here\n\n\\[\nadd~math~text~here\n\\]\n\nYour turn: Interpret the slope and the intercept in the context of the data.\n\nIntercept: Add your response here\nSlopes: Add your response here\n\nYour turn: Recreate the visualization from above, this time adding a regression line to the visualization geom_smooth(method = \"lm\").\n\n\n# add code here\n\n\nWhat is the estimated body mass for a penguin with a flipper length of 210?\n\n\n# add code here\n\n\nWhat is the estimated body mass for a penguin with a flipper length of 100?\n\n\n# add code here\n\n\n\nAnother model\n\nDemo: A different researcher wants to look at body weight of penguins based on the island they were recorded on. How are the variables involved in this analysis different?\n\nAdd response here\n\nDemo: Make an appropriate visualization to investigate this relationship below. Additionally, calculate the mean body mass by island.\n\n\n# add code here\n\n\n# add code here\n\n\nDemo: Change the geom of your previous plot to geom_point().

    "text": "Part 1\nBack to the Midwest!\nIn this part you will revisit and build on some of your findings from Lab 1, where you explored the midwest data frame. Remember that this data frame is bundled with the ggplot2 package and is automatically loaded when you load the tidyverse package. As a refresher, the data contains demographic characteristics of counties in the Midwest region of the United States. You can read documentation for the data set, including variable definitions by typing ?midwest in the Console or searching for midwest in the Help pane.\n\nQuestion 1\nCalculate the number of counties in each state and display your results in descending order of number of counties. Which state has the highest number of counties, and how many? Which state has the lowest number, and how many?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe number of counties in a state can change over time, so the values you see in this output may not be true today.\n\n\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message ‚ÄúAdded answer for Question 1‚Äù.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\nWhile in a given state two counties can‚Äôt have the same name, across states some county names might be shared. A classmate says ‚ÄúLook at that, there is a county called ___ in each state in this dataset!‚Äù In a single pipeline, discover all counties that could fill in the blank. Your response should be a data frame with only the county names that could fill in the blank and how many times they appear in the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou will want to use the filter() function in your answer, which requires a logical condition to describe what you want to filter for. For example filter(x &gt; 2) means filter for values of x greater than 2, filter(y &lt;= 3) means filter for values of y less than or equal to 3.\nThe table below is a summary of logical operators and how to articulate them in R.\n\n\n\noperator\ndefinition\n\n\n\n\n&lt;\nless than\n\n\n&lt;=\nless than or equal to\n\n\n&gt;\ngreater than\n\n\n&gt;=\ngreater than or equal to\n\n\n==\nexactly equal to\n\n\n!=\nnot equal to\n\n\nx & y\nx AND y\n\n\nx¬†|¬†y\nx OR y\n\n\nis.na(x)\ntest if x is NA\n\n\n!is.na(x)\ntest if x is not NA\n\n\nx %in% y\ntest if x is in y\n\n\n!(x %in% y)\ntest if x is not in y\n\n\n!x\nnot x\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message ‚ÄúAdded answer for Question 2‚Äù.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\n\n\nQuestion 3\nReturn to the following box plot of population densities where you were asked to identify at least one outlier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this question part, we want you to revisit this box plot and identify the counties described in each part.\na. The counties with a population density higher than 25,000. Your code must use the filter() function.\nb. The county with the highest population density. Your code must use the max() function.\nAnswer using a single data wrangling pipeline for each part. Your response should be a data frame five columns: county name, state name, population density, total population, and area, in this order. If your response has multiple rows, the data frame should be arranged in descending order of population density.\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message ‚ÄúAdded answer for Question 3‚Äù.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\n\n\nQuestion 4\nIn Lab 1 you were also asked to describe the distribution of population densities. The following is one acceptable description that touches on shape, center, and spread of this distribution. Calculate the values that should go into the blanks.\n\nThe distribution of population density of counties is unimodal and extremely right-skewed. A typical Midwestern county has population density of ____ people per unit area. The middle 50% of the counties have population densities between ___ to ___ people per unit area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThink about which measures of center and spread are appropriate for skewed distributions.\n\n\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message ‚ÄúAdded answer for Question 4‚Äù.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\n\n\nQuestion 5\nAnother visualization from Lab 1 was the following that showed the proportion of urban counties in each state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculate these proportions in a single data pipeline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nRemember, you‚Äôll first need to create a new variable called metro which takes on the value Yes if the value of inmetro is 1, and No otherwise. You can refer to Lab 1 if you need a refresher on how to do this.\n\n\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message ‚ÄúAdded answer for Question 5‚Äù.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\n\n\nQuestion 6\nReturn to the following scatter plot of percentage below poverty vs.¬†percentage of people with a college degree, where the color and shape of points are determined by state where you were asked to identify at least one county that is a clear outlier by name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na. In a single pipeline, identify the observations marked in the orange square on the upper left corner. Your answer should be a data frame with four variables: county, state, percentage below poverty, and percentage college educated.\nb. In a single pipeline, identify the observations marked in the red square in the plot above. Your answer should again be a data frame with four variables: county, state, percentage below poverty, and percentage college educated.\nc. Bring your answers from part (a) and part (b) together! In a single pipeline, and a single filter() statement, identify the observations marked in the red and orange square in the plot above. Your answer should again be a data frame with four variables: county, state, percentage below poverty, and percentage college educated.\nd. Create a new variable in midwest called potential_outlier. This variable should take on the value:\n\nYes if the point is one the ones you identified in part (c), i.e., one of the points marked in the squares in the plot above.\nNo otherwise.\n\nThen, display the updated midwest data frame, with county, state, percentage below poverty, percentage college educated, potential_outlier as the selected variables, arranged in ascending order of potential_outlier.\nc. Recreate the visualization above, i.e.¬†a scatterplot of percentage below poverty vs.¬†percentage of people with a college degree, however color the points by the newly created potential_outlier variable instead of state.\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message ‚ÄúAdded answer for Question 6‚Äù.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\n\n\nQuestion 7\na. In a single pipeline, calculate the total population for each state and save the resulting data frame as state_population and display it in descending order of total population.\nb. Then, in a separate pipeline, calculate the proportion of the total population in each state and, once again, display the results in descending order of proportion of population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn answering parts (a) and (b), you‚Äôll create two new variables, one for total population and other for proportion of total proportion. Make sure to give them ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù names ‚Äì short but evocative.\n\n\nc. Which Midwestern state is most populous and what percent of the Midwest population lives there? Which is the least populous and what percent lives there?\n\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message ‚ÄúAdded answer for Question 7‚Äù.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.\n\n\n\nQuestion 8\nCalculate the average percentage below poverty for each state and save the resulting data frame as state_poverty with the columns state and mean_percbelowpoverty.\nThen, in a new pipeline, display the state_poverty data frame in ascending order of mean_percbelowpoverty. Which state has the lowest average percentage below poverty across its counties?

All of the work for this question will be done in lab-4-clubs-scrape.R.\n\n\nYour task for this question is to scrape data on Duke Student Groups from https://dukegroups.com/club_signup?view=all. Scroll down and click on load all groups.\nYou will do this in lab-4-clubs-scrape.R, which gives some scaffolding for you to complete this task. The goal is to scrape information on\n\nName of club: names\nLink to club page: urls\nType of club: club_types\nResources of club: resources\nMembership type of club: membership_types\nCheckboxes that indicate the club is open / closed for joining: membership_status\n\nThe scheme shown in the image should also help you figure out which pieces of information come from which parts of the website.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will scrape each of these as individual vectors, clean them up a bit, and then bring them together in a data frame (a tibble) and write it out to a CSV file called clubs.csv in the data folder of your project/repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\nThere are some hints for cleaning the data in the script provided for you. For example, some of the fields you scrape will have some extraneous characters in them like \\ns, \\rs, etc. Two examples are provided below.\n\nname &lt;- \"\\r Academic Advising Center\\r\"\nurl &lt;- \"\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thttps://dukegroups.com/AOTA/\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\"\n\nTo clean these up, first, we would want to remove the extraneous characters. The stringr package (which comes with the tidyverse) offers some great functions for dealing with such nuisance, see https://stringr.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html for a full list. In this case, we can use the following steps:\n\nstr_remove() to remove the character(s) once or str_remove_all() to remove all occurences of the character(s) we don‚Äôt want\n\n\nname |&gt;\n  str_remove_all(\"\\r\")\nurl |&gt;\n  str_remove_all(\"\\r\") |&gt;\n  str_remove_all(\"\\n\") |&gt;\n  str_remove_all(\"\\t\")\n\n\nstr_trim() for trimming white space at the beginning and end of text strings\n\n\nname |&gt;\n  str_remove_all(\"\\r\") |&gt;\n  str_trim()\n\nThese types of functions will be helpful for cleaning the data you scrape as well.",

Save the resulting dataset with these two new variables as clubs, i.e., overwrite the data frame.\nThen, display the first 10 rows of the dataset, relocate()ing club_type and detail variables to the beginning of the dataset to make sure they appear in the output in your rendered document.\n\n\nQuestion 3\nAnother variable that needs some cleaning up is membership_status. Currently it should either be NA or contain some text that says \"Select ... to register for this group\". Recode this variable to say \"Closed\" if the current value is NA or \"Open\" otherwise. Save the resulting dataset with these two new variables as clubs, i.e., overwrite the data frame.\nThen, display the first 10 rows of the dataset, relocate()ing membership_status to the beginning of the dataset to make sure it appears in the output in your rendered document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nAt this point you should have a clubs dataset with seven columns in the following order:\n\nname\nresources\nclub_type\ndetail: May be blank for some clubs\nmembership_type\nmembership_status: with values Open and Closed\nurl\n\nIf your dataset has a structure of columns different than what‚Äôs outlined above, go back to earlier exercises and review your answers.",

You are not allowed to use Chat GPT or similar tools in answering these questions ‚Äì you must actually read the articles and summarize them yourself. Please be ethical, at a minimum when discussing ethics!\n\n\n\nQuestion 8\nFor each of the following websites, first determine whether you‚Äôre allowed to scrape data from them using tools we‚Äôve learned in this course.\nThen, read (the relevant portions of their) Terms of Use/Service.\n\nESPN: https://www.espn.com / https://disneytermsofuse.com/english/#License-Grant-and-Restrictions\nX/Twitter: https://twitter.com / https://twitter.com/en/tos\nRotten Tomatoes: https://www.rottentomatoes.com / https://www.rottentomatoes.com/policies/terms-of-use\n\nFinally, summarize your findings about whether you can or cannot scrape data from these websites in 1 sentence for each website. Additionally, quote the relevant sentence(s) from the Terms of Use/Service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\nIn the Terms of Use/Service documents, it might be productive to search for keywords like ‚Äúscrape‚Äù or ‚Äúscraping‚Äù to find the relevant portions.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 9\nOne current ethical discussion in data science involves the training of ‚ÄúLarge Language Models‚Äù such as ChatGPT. These models are trained using massive corpora (document sets) that include large amounts of work that is covered under copyright law. Read the following two articles:\n\nDo Large Language Models Violate Copyright Law?\nReexamining ‚ÄúFair Use‚Äù in the Age of AI\n\nWrite a short paragraph (maximum 8 sentences) discussing the arguments on both sides of the discussion over copyright in training large language models.\n\n\nQuestion 10\nAnother major ethical discussion in data science resolves around discriminatory biases in machine learning models. These biases can have real-world impacts in lending, criminal justice, hiring, and more. Many of these algorithms are so-called ‚Äúblack boxes‚Äù, meaning the exact process they take from input to output is unclear. Read the following articles:\n\nAmazon scraps secret AI recruiting tool that showed bias against\nThe Atlantic: The False Promise of Risk Assessment\n\nWrite a short paragraph (maximum 8 sentences) discussing the nature of biases in machine learning and in datasets, and any possible solutions that could help limit those biases.",

This is your project in a nutshell.\nMay be too long, but please do read\nThe project for this class will consist of analysis on a dataset of your own choosing. The dataset may already exist, or you may collect your own data using a survey or by conducting an experiment. You can choose the data based on your teams‚Äô interests or based on work in other courses or research projects. The goal of this project is for you to demonstrate proficiency in the techniques we have covered in this class (and beyond, if you like) and apply them to a novel dataset in a meaningful way.\nThe goal is not to do an exhaustive data analysis i.e., do not calculate every statistic and procedure you have learned for every variable, but rather let me know that you are proficient at asking meaningful questions and answering them with results of data analysis, that you are proficient in using R, and that you are proficient at interpreting and presenting the results. Focus on methods that help you begin to answer your research questions. You do not have to apply every statistical procedure we learned. Also, critique your own methods and provide suggestions for improving your analysis. Issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data, and appropriateness of the statistical analysis should be discussed here.\nThe project is very open ended. You should create some kind of compelling visualization(s) of this data in R. There is no limit on what tools or packages you may use but sticking to packages we learned in class is required. You do not need to visualize all of the data at once. A single high-quality visualization will receive a much higher grade than a large number of poor-quality visualizations. Also pay attention to your presentation. Neatness, coherency, and clarity will count. All analyses must be done in RStudio, using R, and all components of the project must be reproducible (with the exception of the presentation).\nYou will work on the project with your lab teams.\nThe four milestones for the final project are\n\nMilestone 1 - Working collaboratively\nMilestone 2 - Proposals, with three dataset ideas\nMilestone 3 - Peer review, on another team‚Äôs project\nMilestone 4 - Presentation with slides and a reproducible project writeup of your analysis, with a draft along the way.\n\nYou will not be submitting anything on Gradescope for the project. Submission of these deliverables will happen on GitHub and feedback will be provided as GitHub issues that you need to engage with and close. The collection of the documents in your GitHub repo will create a webpage for your project. To create the webpage go to the Build tab in RStudio, and click on Render Website.",

You are free to add additional sections as necessary. The report, including visualizations, should be no more than 10 pages long (if it were to be printed). There is no minimum page requirement; however, you should comprehensively address all of the analysis in your report.\nTo check how many pages your report is, open it in your browser and go to File &gt; Print &gt; Save as PDF and review the number of pages.\nBe selective in what you include in your final write-up. The goal is to write a cohesive narrative that demonstrates a thorough and comprehensive analysis rather than explain every step of the analysis.\nYou are welcome to include an appendix with additional work at the end of the written report document; however, grading will largely be based on the content in the main body of the report.

If you‚Äôve chosen to do inference, make sure to include a justification for why that inferential approach is appropriate. If you‚Äôve chosen to do modeling, describe the model(s) you‚Äôre fitting, predictor variables considered for the model including any interactions. Additionally, show how you arrived at the final model by describing the model selection process, interactions considered, variable transformations (if needed), assessment of conditions and diagnostics, and any other relevant considerations that were part of the model fitting process.\n\n\nThe analysis steps are appropriate for the data and research question. The group used a thorough and careful approach to determine analyses types and addressed any concerns over appropriateness of analyses chosen.\n\n\n\n\nThis is where you will discuss your overall finding and describe the key results from your analysis. The goal is not to interpret every single element of an output shown, but instead to address the research questions, using the interpretations to support your conclusions. Focus on the variables that help you answer the research question and that provide relevant context for the reader.\n\n\nThe analysis results are clearly assesses and interesting findings from the analysis are described. Interpretations are used to to support the key findings and conclusions, rather than merely listing, e.g., the interpretation of every model coefficient.\n\n\n\n\nIn this section you‚Äôll include a summary of what you have learned about your research question along with statistical arguments supporting your conclusions. In addition, discuss the limitations of your analysis and provide suggestions on ways the analysis could be improved.

It should also include some exploratory data analysis. All of the EDA won‚Äôt fit in the paper, so focus on the EDA for the response variable and a few other interesting variables and relationships.\n\n\nThe research question and motivation are clearly stated in the introduction, including citations for the data source and any external research. The data are clearly described, including a description about how the data were originally collected and a concise definition of the variables relevant to understanding the report. The data cleaning process is clearly described, including any decisions made in the process (e.g., creating new variables, removing observations, etc.) The exploratory data analysis helps the reader better understand the observations in the data along with interesting and relevant relationships between the variables. It incorporates appropriate visualizations and summary statistics.\n\n\n\n\nThis section includes a brief description of your analysis process. Explain the reasoning for the types of analyses you do, exploratory, inferential, or modeling. If you‚Äôve chosen to do inference, make sure to include a justification for why that inferential approach is appropriate. If you‚Äôve chosen to do modeling, describe the model(s) you‚Äôre fitting, predictor variables considered for the model including any interactions. Additionally, show how you arrived at the final model by describing the model selection process, interactions considered, variable transformations (if needed), assessment of conditions and diagnostics, and any other relevant considerations that were part of the model fitting process.\n\n\nThe analysis steps are appropriate for the data and research question. The group used a thorough and careful approach to determine analyses types and addressed any concerns over appropriateness of analyses chosen.\n\n\n\n\nThis is where you will discuss your overall finding and describe the key results from your analysis. The goal is not to interpret every single element of an output shown, but instead to address the research questions, using the interpretations to support your conclusions. Focus on the variables that help you answer the research question and that provide relevant context for the reader.\n\n\nThe analysis results are clearly assesses and interesting findings from the analysis are described. Interpretations are used to to support the key findings and conclusions, rather than merely listing, e.g., the interpretation of every model coefficient.\n\n\n\n\nIn this section you‚Äôll include a summary of what you have learned about your research question along with statistical arguments supporting your conclusions. In addition, discuss the limitations of your analysis and provide suggestions on ways the analysis could be improved.

BP was assessed using the last 3 of 10 measurements after 10¬†minutes‚Äô rest in the supine position. Hypertension was defined as systolic BP ‚â•140¬†mm¬†Hg and/or diastolic BP ‚â•90¬†mm¬†Hg and/or use of antihypertensives. In regression analysis, higher commuting and leisure‚Äêtime but not occupational MVPA related to lower BP and lower hypertension risk. Commuting‚Äêand‚Äêleisure‚Äêtime MVPA was associated with BP in a dose‚Äêdependent manner. Œ≤ Coefficients (95% CI) from linear regression analyses were ‚àí1.64 (‚àí2.03 to ‚àí1.24), ‚àí2.29 (‚àí2.68 to ‚àí1.90), and finally ‚àí2.90 (‚àí3.29 to ‚àí2.50) mm¬†Hg systolic BP for the low, middle, and highest tertile of MVPA compared with ‚ÄúNo MVPA‚Äù as the reference group after adjusting for age, sex, education, smoking and alcohol use. Further adjustment for body mass index attenuated the associations by 30% to 50%, but more MVPA remained significantly associated with lower BP and lower risk of hypertension. This association was age dependent. Œ≤ Coefficients (95% CI) for the highest tertiles of commuting‚Äêand‚Äêleisure‚Äêtime MVPA were ‚àí1.67 (‚àí2.20 to ‚àí1.15), ‚àí3.39 (‚àí3.94 to ‚àí2.82) and ‚àí4.64 (‚àí6.15 to ‚àí3.14) mm¬†Hg systolic BP in adults &lt;40, 40 to 60, and &gt;60¬†years, respectively.\nConclusions: Higher commuting and leisure‚Äêtime but not occupational MVPA were significantly associated with lower BP and lower hypertension risk at all ages, but these associations were stronger in older adults."

BERT, its variants, GPT-2/3, and others, most recently Switch-C, have pushed the boundaries of the possible both through architectural innovations and through sheer size. Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.\n\n\n\n\n‚àí+\n05:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is meant by ‚Äústochastic parrots‚Äù in the paper title?"

Over the past several decades, many statistical methods have been proposed to address this ecological inference problem. We propose an alternative method to reduce aggregation bias by predicting individual-level ethnicity from voter registration records. Building on the existing methodological literature, we use Bayes‚Äôs rule to combine the Census Bureau‚Äôs Surname List with various information from geocoded voter registration records. We evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology using approximately nine million voter registration records from Florida, where self-reported ethnicity is available. We find that it is possible to reduce the false positive rate among Black and Latino voters to 6% and 3%, respectively, while maintaining the true positive rate above 80%. Moreover, we use our predictions to estimate turnout by race and find that our estimates yields substantially less amounts of bias and root mean squared error than standard ecological inference estimates. We provide open-source software to implement the proposed methodology. The open-source software is available for implementing the proposed methodology."
